#function inside class is method,outside class is function.In python everything is inside class,so there is only method

def sum():   # method declare + define 
    a=int(input("Enter number 1 "))
    b=int(input("Enter number 2 "))

    c=a+b
    return c

r1 =sum()
print("r1= ",r1)

r2 =sum()
print("r2= ",r2)

r3 =sum()
print("r3= ",r3)
